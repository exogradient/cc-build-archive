  "name": "CronCreate",
  "description": "Schedule a prompt to be enqueued at a future time. Use for both recurring schedules and one-shot reminders.\n\nUses standard 5-field cron in the user's local timezone: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week. \"0 9 * * *\" means 9am local \u2014 no timezone conversion needed.\n\n## One-shot tasks (recurring: false)\n\nFor \"remind me at X\" or \"at <time>, do Y\" requests \u2014 fire once then auto-delete.\nPin minute/hour/day-of-month/month to specific values:\n  \"remind me at 2:30pm today to check the deploy\" \u2192 cron: \"30 14 <today_dom> <today_month> *\", recurring: false\n  \"tomorrow morning, run the smoke test\" \u2192 cron: \"57 8 <tomorrow_dom> <tomorrow_month> *\", recurring: false\n\n## Recurring jobs (recurring: true, the default)\n\nFor \"every N minutes\" / \"every hour\" / \"weekdays at 9am\" requests:\n  \"*/5 * * * *\" (every 5 min), \"0 * * * *\" (hourly), \"0 9 * * 1-5\" (weekdays at 9am local)\n\n## Avoid the :00 and :30 minute marks when the task allows it\n\nEvery user who asks for \"9am\" gets `0 9`, and every user who asks for \"hourly\" gets `0 *` \u2014 which means requests from across the planet land on the API at the same instant. When the user's request is approximate, pick a minute that is NOT 0 or 30:\n  \"every morning around 9\" \u2192 \"57 8 * * *\" or \"3 9 * * *\" (not \"0 9 * * *\")\n  \"hourly\" \u2192 \"7 * * * *\" (not \"0 * * * *\")\n  \"in an hour or so, remind me to...\" \u2192 pick whatever minute you land on, don't round\n\nOnly use minute 0 or 30 when the user names that exact time and clearly means it (\"at 9:00 sharp\", \"at half past\", coordinating with a meeting). When in doubt, nudge a few minutes early or late \u2014 the user will not notice, and the fleet will.\n\n## Durability\n\nBy default (durable: false) the job lives only in this Claude session \u2014 nothing is written to disk, and the job is gone when Claude exits. Pass durable: true to write to .claude/scheduled_tasks.json so the job survives restarts. Only use durable: true when the user explicitly asks for the task to persist (\"keep doing this every day\", \"set this up permanently\"). Most \"remind me in 5 minutes\" / \"check back in an hour\" requests should stay session-only.\n\n## Runtime behavior\n\nJobs only fire while the REPL is idle (not mid-query). Durable jobs persist to .claude/scheduled_tasks.json and survive session restarts \u2014 on next launch they resume automatically. One-shot durable tasks that were missed while the REPL was closed are surfaced for catch-up. Session-only jobs die with the process. The scheduler adds a small deterministic jitter on top of whatever you pick: recurring tasks fire up to 10% of their period late (max 15 min); one-shot tasks landing on :00 or :30 fire up to 90 s early. Picking an off-minute is still the bigger lever.\n\nRecurring tasks auto-expire after 7 days \u2014 they fire one final time, then are deleted. This bounds session lifetime. Tell the user about the 7-day limit when scheduling recurring jobs.\n\nReturns a job ID you can pass to CronDelete.",
