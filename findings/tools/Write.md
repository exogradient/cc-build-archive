{
  "name": "Write",
  "description": "Writes a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- Prefer the Edit tool for modifying existing files \u2014 it only sends the diff. Only use this tool to create new files or for complete rewrites.\n- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.",
