## Current definition

```json
{
  "name": "Read",
  "description": "Reads a file from the local filesystem.\n\n- `file_path` must be an absolute path.\n- Reads up to 2000 lines by default.\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- Reads images (PNG, JPG, \u2026) and presents them visually. Reads PDFs via the `pages` parameter (e.g. \"1-5\", max 20 pages/request; required for PDFs over 10 pages). Reads Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) as cells with outputs.\n- Reading a directory, a missing file, or an empty file returns an error or system reminder rather than content.\n- Do NOT re-read a file you just edited to verify \u2014 Edit/Write would have errored if the change failed, and the harness tracks file state for you.",
