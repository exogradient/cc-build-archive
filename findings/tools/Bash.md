  "description": "Executes a bash command and returns its output.\n\n- Working directory persists between calls, but prefer absolute paths \u2014 `cd` in a compound command can trigger a permission prompt. Shell state (env vars, functions) does not persist; the shell is initialized from the user's profile.\n- IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user.\n- `timeout` is in milliseconds: default 120000, max 600000.\n- `run_in_background` runs the command detached: it keeps running across turns and re-invokes you when it exits. No `&` needed.\n\n# Git\n- Interactive flags (`-i`, e.g. `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`) are not supported in this environment.\n- Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, API).\n- Commit or push only when the user asks. If on the default branch, branch first.\n- End git commit messages with:\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>\n- End PR bodies with:\n\ud83e\udd16 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)",
